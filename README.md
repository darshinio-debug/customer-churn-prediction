## Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn — the likelihood that a customer will stop using a company’s service. By analyzing behavioral and demographic data, this machine learning model helps businesses identify customers at risk and take proactive steps to retain them.

## Dataset
The dataset contains customer information such as demographics, account details, and service usage patterns.  
Each record is labeled as "Churn" or "Not Churn".

## Methodology
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for feature relationships
3. Feature selection and scaling
4. Model building using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
5. Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score

## Results
- Achieved 80% accuracy and 0.79 ROC-AUC score on test data.
- Identified key factors influencing churn such as tenure, monthly charges, and contract type.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Google Colab

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to business problems like churn prediction.  
Future improvements may include deep learning models and deployment using Streamlit or Flask for real-time churn prediction.
